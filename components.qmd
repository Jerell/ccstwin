# Network composition

## Wells and perforations

The analogue functions are designed to imitate the behaviour of wells and perforations by taking data about their inputs and outputs and fitting a curve to those data points. We trust the functions to cover the range we were provided data for, but nothing beyond that.

The data points are all from previous flow assurance cases, so they cover the expected operating range, but we have little if any data points for the extremes of our input space. Our search algorithms are not constrained to only cover the expected operating range.

## Splitters

The flowrate search in the splitter relies on the assumption that the relationship between the flowrate in a branch and the outlet pressure is injective. If any two flowrates produce the same outlet pressure then we can't use a binary search to explore the range of outputs.

By testing a range of flowrates for a particular branch, we found a case where the outlet pressure at 2 kgps was higher than both 1 kgps and 3 kgps. This may be extremely low, but it's within our domain so it's a number our search could potentially settle on.

## Inlet pressure search

This also relies on the assumption that the relationship between the input and output is injective. It's the same kind of search, but just changing a different variable. It's possible that a higher inlet pressure does always produce a higher outlet pressure but nobody has demonstrated that.
