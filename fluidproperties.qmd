# Fluid properties

We look up fluid properties from a tab file and we probably don't have to.

We've trained a neural network to predict fluid properties for different compositions and we probably don't have to do that either.

The neural network was trained on the tab files generated by Multiflash. The tab files are generated by calculating the properties using an equation of state. People publish their equations of state.
