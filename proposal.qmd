# Proposal

Create an interface for defining and sequencing network segments. Model the network as a system of PDEs. Use the finite difference method to [find solutions](solving.qmd). Produce visualizations that inform the user of the relevant thresholds and margins necessary to provide context for the model output.

The solutions would have to be computed whenever we want results for a different network definition or fluid composition, but if you know the [parameters](fluidproperties.qmd#parameters) for the fluid components, then it doesn't take weeks of training a neural net to calculate thermodynamic properties.

If you want to be able to do compositional tracking, you need to be able to model a subsection of the network with a different composition than the rest anyway. Treating each branch (or section between [discontinuity points](solving.qmd#discontinuity-points)) as separate allows you to do that.

## Interface

If we need a web UI, it makes sense to use React and D3. 

## Model

I would choose Julia for the network model. Its [speed is comparable to Rust](https://julialang.org/benchmarks/) and it has features and packages that make it well suited for scientific and differentiable programming. When it comes to [solving](https://nextjournal.com/sosiris-de/pde-2018) differential equations in particular, there are [lots of options](https://github.com/JuliaPDE/SurveyofPDEPackages#finite-difference-methods). Functions can be written in a way that more closely resembles the maths notation that would be familiar to SMEs.


## Risks and challenges

- **Problem definition and focus:** It's important to understand what we're doing and what a useful outcome looks like.
- **Lack of resources and help:** It may not always be easy or possible to make progress without input from SMEs who may not always be available. I don't actually know these techniques myself so I'd be learning as I go.
- **New language:** If we use Julia, it may be more difficult for people to get involved in the project if they aren't familiar with the language. It's not that hard to [pick up](https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started_julia/julia_by_example.html) though.
