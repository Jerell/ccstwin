# What if?

*What-if modelling* is the evaluation of the network given certain inputs and constraints.

It is not the same as [solving the network](solving.qmd). The forward pass in our search loops could be considered *what-if modelling* because in that forward pass we're asking *what happens at the outlet if the inlet pressure is X* but the output of the model isn't the answer to that question.

Evaluating $f(x) = x^2 - 16$ would look like $f(x)\vert_{x=5} = 9$ whereas solving it might look like
$$
x^2 - 16 = 0 \\
(x - 4)(x + 4) = 0 \\
x = 4, x = -4
$$

What we're making is closer to an algorithm for solving an equation using a particular method than it is to a function that can be evaluated with any inputs. And the method doesn't work if certain assumptions aren't true. And we make no attempt to validate those assumptions.
